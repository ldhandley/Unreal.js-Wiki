## For a fresh start
1. Create a new C++ project
1. Open terminal
```
# download plugin
wget https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js-core/releases/download/ready-to-build/Unreal.js-core.zip
mkdir -p Plugins/UnrealJS
unzip Unreal.js-core.zip -d 

# build and run!
open <your project>.uproject
```

* There is no need to see XCode running

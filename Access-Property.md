In Unreal Engine, there is a different problem with String values when the FName is in the WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA environment and not in the environment. This causes many problems in the scripting of the packaging environment.

So, PropertyName (FName) has been modified with the same value regardless of whether it is an editor or not. Starting from 4.19, the name of the property declared in the code should be used instead of the name of FName generated by Reflection.

```cpp
USTURCT ()
struct FSomeStruct
{
   UPROPERTY()
   int32 Id;
}
```

```js
var some = new SomeStruct ()
JSON.stringify (some) => {"ID": 0}
=> some.Id (X)
=> some.ID (O)

```

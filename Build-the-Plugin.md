- Make sure you have installed the [UnrealEngine 4.12.0 canonical build](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard).
- Create a UE4 C++ project and close the editor after the project creation is finished
- Clone the content of [Unreal.js-core](https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js-core) into the `{ProjectRoot}\Plugins\UnrealJS` directory of the UE4 project directory
- (or download the [ready to build Zip file](https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js-core/releases/tag/ready-to-build) and extract it in the `{ProjectRoot}\Plugins\UnrealJS` directory)
- Download the [V8 prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js-core/releases/tag/v8-5.1.300-win64) or [build them yourself](https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js/wiki/V8) and put them in the `{ProjectRoot}\Plugins\UnrealJS\ThirdParty\v8\lib\Win64\Release` directory
- Now open the C++ `.uproject` again in the UE editor
- Once the UE Editor opens the project it should ask if you want to rebuild the plugin modules, click `Yes` to start the C++ build
- The compilation of the Unreal.js plugin should go through and you end up with a compiled version of the plugin in the `{ProjectRoot}\Plugins\UnrealJS` directory
- To verify that the C++ binaries of the plugin have been built check that the DLLs for the plugin have been created in `{ProjectRoot}\Plugins\UnrealJS\Binaries\Win64`
- In the UE Editor you can check that the plugin was successfully loaded in `Edit > Plugins > Project > Programming > Unreal.js - Javascript Runtime`
- You can then start using the plugin in the project or copy the built plugin folder to a different UE project (Blueprint or C++) and use it there

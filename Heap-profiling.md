You can inspect heap status with [Chrome heap profiler](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling).

`memory.takeSnapshot(filename)` dumps heap snapshot. CWD(current working directory) is `Engine/Binaries/{Platform}`. 

This feature was added in [6daa9](https://github.com/ncsoft/Unreal.js-core/commit/6daa9bdbff316d11c70ae602538e108838897b8f).
